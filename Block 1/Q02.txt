The standard cmd that can be easily accessed on windows is relatively limited and operates on a keystroke -> shell system where,
the users keystrokes are sent to the shell to let it process them and understand what the user wants.
Powershell technology allows the users keystrokes to be packed as rich objects that are passed along, allowing for much more manipulation
and query ability.
